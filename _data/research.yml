  questions:
   - q: What is finding in this research?  
     description: "Using the data from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble, we find that climate change has already doubled the likelihood of an event capable of producing catastrophic flooding, but larger future increases are likely due to continued warming."
   - q: What is the impact of the possible risk?
     description: "We further find that runoff in the future extreme storm scenario is 200 to 400% greater than historical values in the Sierra Nevada because of increased precipitation rates and decreased snow fraction. These findings have direct implications for flood and emergency management, as well as broader implications for hazard mitigation and climate adaptation activities."

  questions:
   - q: Research Overview
     description: "Precipitation extremes over the western US are a major focus of my work, due to their deleterious impacts on ecosystems and human society; these impacts are projected to intensify under a warming climate. Part of my research program focuses on understanding how large-scale forcing and climate variability affect the behavior of precipitation extremes, and how both are affected by uncertainty due to climate model biases. Given the large uncertainties within global climate models and the importance of internal (unforced) climate variability, I use large ensembles -- that is, sets of many simulations with identical model physics but different initial conditions, to improve statistical significance and identify consistent aspects of forced changes in 21st century climate projections"

  questions:
   - q: Research Overview
     description: "Characterized by narrow and filamentary corridors of enhanced water vapor flux, ARs are of outsized importance along the U.S. West Coast. However, the formation, propagation, and controlling factors for ARsâ€™ evolution and changes are not well understood. It is crucial to combine both observations and models to improve this understanding. A significant portion of my recent research efforts has been devoted to investigating historical AR events and using climate models to simulate and diagnose the characteristics and future projections of ARs, especially those with the greatest impacts"

  questions:
   - q: Research Overview  
     description: "There are significant implications for snowpack, water resources, streamflow, and flooding risk, etc under a warming climate and intensified climate extremes. As the drought condition predicts to be more severe and precipitation to be more extreme, the loss of snowpack and intensified flood risk informs policymakers for better climate adaptation strategies for water resources supply and flood control. My recent research efforts have also been devoted to studying regional hydroclimate impacts and to provide scientific support to public communities. I am also involved in ongoing collaborations on examining the consequences of ArkStorm scenarios in a highly populated urban environment and how precipitation extremes can affect landslides and post-wildfire debris flows."

  questions:
   - q: Research Overview  
     description: "Climate downscaling enables connections between regional and global scales, and across disciplines (particularly between hydrologic, atmospheric, and land-surface processes). The strength of such linkages (such as, future water resources, flooding control, land-use impacts) could provide significant ways to resolve real-world problems under changing climatic and environmental conditions. The need for high-resolution data is increasingly fast and it usually requires intensive computational practices and resources. I have been focused on improving regional scale climate studies by pushing forward state-of-the-art high-resolution modeling methods."
