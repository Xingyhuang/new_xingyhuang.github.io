    - q: Research summary
      description: "By isolating internal variability from external forcings, my work aims to understand how large-scale climate variability affect precipitation extremes changes (Huang and Stevenson, 2021, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001944; Huang and Stevenson, 2023a, in revision). Research efforts also include the generation of a new large ensemble of simulations (Stevenson and Huang et al., 2023b, in revision)."

    - q: Research summary
      description: "Historical warming had already exacerbated runoff conditions (Huang et al., 2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018GL077432). Future changes of surface runoff driven by intensified storm events are dramatic, reflecting both the precipitation increase and reduced snowfall (Huang et al., 2020c, https://doi.org/10.1029/2020GL088679). Results have significant implications for water resource management and flood control and for both the public and strategy-makers."
