    - q: Research summary
      description: "By isolating internal variability from external forcings, my work aims to understand how large-scale climate variability affect precipitation extremes changes (Huang and Stevenson, 2021; Huang and Stevenson, 2023a, in revision). Research efforts also include the generation of a new large ensemble of simulations (Stevenson and Huang et al., 2023b, in revision)."

    - q: Research summary
      description: "Historical warming had already exacerbated runoff conditions (Huang et al., 2018). Future changes of surface runoff driven by intensified storm events are dramatic, reflecting both the precipitation increase and reduced snowfall (Huang et al., 2020c). Results have significant implications for water resource management and flood control and for both the public and strategy-makers."

      description: "My other leading work focuses on advancing high-resolution and new-generation storm-resolving modeling and simulations (Huang et al., 2022b; Huang, 2023, in revision). Past efforts also involve regional climate studies built upon cutting-edge modeling and downscaling strategies (Huang et al., 2016a; Huang and Ullrich, 2016b; Huang and Ullrich, 2017)."
